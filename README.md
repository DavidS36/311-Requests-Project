# 311-Service-Requests-Project
This is an "end-of-phase" project that I am conducting within the Flatiron School curriculum. For this project, I will be looking at NYC's 311 database which contains records of every 311 Service Request since 2010. With this I will be asking five descriptive questions and presenting my findings.

Data is from NYC Open Data
